                <h1>Education</h1>
                <p>I'm currently pursuing my first degree in professional studies at Brigham Young University-Idaho,
                    specializing in programming and web development. I'm super excited to graduate in 2025 and put my
                    skills to good use. On top of that, I've also obtained a web development certificate from Coursera,
                    courtesy of Google. It's been an incredible journey of growth and improvement as I've honed my web
                    development skills over the years. I'm always striving to perfect my craft and stay up-to-date with
                    the latest trends and technologies.</p>

                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <p>I've always had a passion for coding since I was a kid. Can you believe it? I've been coding in HTML
                    and CSS for over 8 years now, and I've become quite proficient in frameworks like Next.js. It's been
                    such an exciting journey working on various projects for individuals and small companies. One of the
                    projects I'm really proud of is creating a website for a small outsource company called Africa
                    Helping Hand. I've also had the opportunity to work on impressive personal portfolios and other cool
                    projects. It's been such a rewarding experience seeing my coding skills come to life.</p>

                <h1>Skills and languages</h1>
                <p>When it comes to web development, I've got some pretty solid skills under my belt. I'm really
                    proficient in HTML and CSS, and I'm still working on improving my JavaScript skills. But hey, we're
                    all a work in progress, right? Besides coding, I'm also a great researcher, always digging deep to
                    find the best solutions. I love being a creative thinker and putting my designing skills to good
                    use. It's such a fulfilling feeling when I can bring my creative ideas to life.</p>
